This directory contains unit tests that must pass before anything can
be released. At this time the coverage is, er, rather poor. But the
idea is this will evolve into a proper regression test suite that
every commit / batch of commits should pass before being accepted to
the master branch.

* 2019-04-22 Thoughts on CardDAV gold testing

As of today there is no automated testing for CardDAV sync (or any of
the others for that matter). Here are some thoughts on what it could be.

CardDAV testing can be along following lines:

Pre-requisites:
  - CardDAV server on locahost
  - test principal account

Test 1
- Clear all the contacts
- Initialize ASynK with a sample BBDB file and write a bunch of
  contacts to the CardDAV server
- make a raw HTTP or other carddav query for contacts, and validate
  number of contacts and contents.

The last step might require us to use this project or something
similar to: https://github.com/apple/ccs-caldavtester for automation.
