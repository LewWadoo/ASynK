This directory contains random test and exploration code that can be
used to activate and test specific areas of the code base in
isolation. In particular the "gold/" directory is meant to be the full
unit test suite that every change should pass before commit. This
directory, otoh, is to do some probing (like print a given outlook
entry, or clear specific flags, or some such one time operation in a
debug cycle).

** CardDav testing

*** Setup Baikal on localhost

At various points in the past I have used CardDav servers from Baikal
and Apple "Calendar Server".

On upgrading to macOS Mojave stuff stopped working and I had to redo a
bunch of things in Apr 2019:

- Set up Apache, like so:
  https://coolestguidesontheplanet.com/install-apache-mysql-php-on-macos-mojave-10-14/
  (and a bunch of other stuff to get the basic Apache config in
  order).

- Set up Baikal: http://sabre.io/baikal/install/ Ran into this error:
  "Ba√Økal needs to have write permissions in the Specific/ folder."
  Had to make that directory world writable. Oh well.

  Eventually http://localhost/baikal/html/admin/install worked well,
  and was able to complete some basic config and baikal installation
  was completed

  Created a new test account with following credentials:
  - username: unittest1 and unittest2
  - email: karra.etc@gmail.com
  - Password: <saved to Chrome profile> for URL localhost/baikal/html

  This is super useful information for later reference:
  http://sabre.io/dav/building-a-carddav-client/

- Finally set up Baikal to be on a separate virtualhost with the
  following config:

<VirtualHost *:80>
    DocumentRoot /Library/WebServer/Documents/baikal/html
    ServerName baikal

    RewriteEngine On
    RewriteRule /.well-known/carddav /dav.php [R,L]
    RewriteRule /.well-known/caldav /dav.php [R,L]

    <Directory "/Library/WebServer/Documents/baikal/html">
        Options None
	Options +FollowSymlinks
	AllowOverride All

	# Confiugration for apache-2.2:
	Order allow,deny
	Allow from all

	# Confiugration for apache-2.4:
	Require all granted
    </Directory>
</VirtualHost>

  Note that the main localhost stuff is as follows:

<VirtualHost *:80>
    DocumentRoot "/Library/WebServer/Documents"
    ServerName localhost
    <Directory "/Library/WebServer/Documents">
        Options FollowSymLinks Multiviews
        MultiviewsMatch Any
        AllowOverride None
        Require all granted
    </Directory>
</VirtualHost>

***  Testing - MacOS Mojave Contacts does not work

Also tried using caldavclientlibrary to inspect the carddav server

- One of the main problemsin testing carddav automatically is to
  effect changes on the server via "other means" - either
  programmatically or manually through another interface. Setting up
  Apple Contacts on Mac to read the carddav server has been a pain.

  2019-04-27: The following config does not work:
  - CardDAV, Manual
  - username:password (same as what I used for ASynK)
  - Server Address: http://localhost/baikal/html/card.php
  - Server Path: /addressbooks/unittest1/default/

  Tried a bunch of variations on the Server path to
  /addressbooks/default/ etc but nothing works

  I tried enabling some network logging in OSX, like so:

     $ defaults write com.apple.AddressBook.CardDAVPlugin EnableDebug -bool YES
     $ defaults write com.apple.AddressBook.CardDAVPlugin LogConnectionDetails -bool YES

  And logs were supposed to show up using Console.app in
  ~/Library/Logs; it does not work. Just WTF...

*** Testing - BusyContacts works and displays contacts from Baikal

Installed 30 day trial version of https://www.busymac.com/busycontacts/ and it just
worked with the localhost version of Baikal.

username: unittest1
Password: <from chrome password manager>
server: http://baikal/ - that's it.

Testing flow was like so:

- Clear all c
